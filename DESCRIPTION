Description: Creates publication-ready Table 1 (baseline characteristics table) 
    following common scientific journal formatting requirements. Automatically 
    detects variable types, performs appropriate statistical tests, and formats 
    results according to scientific publication standards. Supports both continuous 
    and categorical variables, handles normal and non-normal distributions, and 
    provides proper statistical test selection.
